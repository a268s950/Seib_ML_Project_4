Assignment Project 4 - Treasure Hunters Inc.   
We do the treasure hunting and monster fighting for you 
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account 
2. Think up a map-like environment with treasure, obstacles and opponents 
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java) 
4. Formulate ideas on how reinforcement learning can be used to find treasure efficiently while avoiding obstacles and opponents 
5. Build one or more reinforcement policies to model situational assessments, actions and rewards programmatically 
6. Document your process and results 
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub 

Notes:
This project has one exploitation policy and one exploration policy.
Options: moving monsters, but not necessary. focus on policies and learning aspect.
Deep RL isn't necessary, basic Q learning is fine.
Can the policies be deterministic or stoachastic approach?
A deterministic algorithm is fine.
The example he gave was a fixed size array markedw ith Xs and Os is good enough.
