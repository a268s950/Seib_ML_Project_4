    "The agent receives a positive reward for escaping the maze. If the agent runs into a monster without first having a sword, the agent receives a penalty. The agent gets a lesser penalty for every step that does not escape the maze. This is because the main goal of the game is to escape the maze, and we want the agent to reach the end of the maze overall, rather than make the wrong move to reach the end of the maze faster.\n",
